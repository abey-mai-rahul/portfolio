STEPS TO VIEW YOUR PORTFOLIO:
------------------------------

1. Download all files from this folder
2. Create the folder structure exactly as shown above
3. Double-click "filmmaking-portfolio.html" to open in your browser

If videos, photos, or stills don't show:
- Check that all files are in the correct folders
- Try opening in a different browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Make sure the file names match exactly (case-sensitive)

NEW FEATURE - STILLS GALLERY:
-----------------------------
- First 4 stills are shown initially
- Click "VIEW MORE" to reveal all 9 stills
- Click "VIEW LESS" to collapse back to 4
- Stills have cinematic hover effects

TROUBLESHOOTING:
----------------
- Photo not showing? Check profile-photo.jpg is in the root folder
- Hero video not showing? Check surreal.mp4 is in the root folder  
- Contact video not showing? Check HOSPITAL_LOOP.mp4 is in the root folder
- Stills not showing? Check the stills/ subfolder exists with all PNG files
- Some browsers block autoplay - just refresh the page if videos don't start

Your portfolio is complete and ready to share!
